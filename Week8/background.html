    <p><b id="titles">About Me</b><br>Just to give you persepective on how I can help you be better at your chosen game I'll give you a little bit of what I have acheived in each <br>game.</p>
    <p><b id="titles">CS:GO</b><br>I have spent most of my time playing CS:GO. I have played on and off for more than 5 years and am approaching the 10k hour benchamark <br>that most people say you have to acheive to 
        really understand the game. I play with current and formal pros and soon-to-be pros on a regular <br>basis and am constantly exposed to new methods of playing the game whether it's general
        awareness of what is happening, map control, <br>utility, strats, good lurks, proper comms, etc. I have a lot of knowledge that I can give, and look forward to helping you get to your next level. </p>
    <p><b id="titles">Valorant</b><br>Valorant has a lot of the same principles as does CS:GO. I spent some time playing with friends, before getting serious about the game and <br>grinding to Radiant. Sometimes there is a daunting level of inconsistency in lower ranks like Gold and Plat, but with the right
    help you <br>can get to play in the Immortal, and Radiant ranks. We will work on your mental fortitude, and overall understanding of the game to get you there.</p>
    <p><b id="titles">Apex Legends</b><br>Apex Legends is by far one of my favorite game to grind in my off time with Counterstrike. There is just a very unique style of play about Apex.<br>
    I have played at the highest level of Diamond in Apex. I know what it takes to be good, and to be good consistently. If you struggle with the <br>consistency of placemenet and going positive every game, then I can help you.
One incredibly underrated tip that I will give you for free is that you <br>MUST have fun. If the game you are grinding becomes a burden it's time to take a break, or re-think the game you play all-together.</p>
